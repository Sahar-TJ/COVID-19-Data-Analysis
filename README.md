We all know in 2019, China had it's first Coronavirus case. Since then, the novel disease had spread like a wildfire, resulting in COVID-19 pandemic.
Over the course of roughly 3 years, the SARS-CoV-2 caused over 641 million cases and around 6.63 million fatalities.

In some way or the other, we all have been affected by Covid-19. The normal lifestyle of every human being has been bent into a new one. Most of the people now have to work or study online. However, there are still people who have to risk their lives in order to maintain the functioning of things. For instance, doctors, pilots, and other social workers.

They made a huge contribution to the world at a very challenging time. Keeping that in mind, I have performed a small analysis project. This has been the most overdue project. It is a simple Data Analysis on COVID-19 and how it had it's effect around the World.
